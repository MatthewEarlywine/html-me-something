          <p>The night: Dark, stormy.</p> 
        </article>
        <p>Our protagonist (yours truly): Trying his best to avoid being swept out to sea.</p>  
        <p>The scene: A stairwell leading down off the street. It could very well lead anywhere, but the rain
            was coming down, the wind was picking up, and the grimy sign reading "Bess' Place" was still lit up,
            so I decided to take my chances and prayed the pub was still open. Vnd for that matter, actually was 
            a pub.</p>


          Story notes: 
             Behind the bar: Li Bai, smiling and cleaning glasses.
             Bes: dancing some sort of jig on a table while a small crowd of onlookers cheers him on.
             At a table near the hearth: Thor, Sif, and Frigga, all trying to calm down a visibly furious Odin,
               who is staring daggers across the room...
             Across the room: ...at Zeus, rejoining friends near the dartboards after making not-so-subtle 
             suggestions to Frigga. Hera sits nearby, a pinched expression on her face.
