        <p>Our protagonist (yours truly): Trying his best to avoid being swept out to sea.</p>  
        <p>The scene: A stairwell leading down off the street. It could very well lead anywhere, but the rain
            was coming down, the wind was picking up, and the grimy sign reading "Bess' Place" was still lit up,
            so I decided to take my chances and prayed the pub was still open. Vnd for that matter, actually was 
            a pub.</p>
