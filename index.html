            <p>For as long as I can remember, I have loved to read. Mysteries, adventures, mythologies, histories, you 
               name it and I just ate it up. So, with books being such a large part of my life, I&apos;d like to share
               some of my personal favorite books with you.</p>

            <li><h2><u>After Man: A Zoology of the Future</u></h2></li>
            <h3>By: Dougal Dixon</h3>
            <br><br>
         
            <p>This text presents possible outcomes on the development of life on Earth one million years
               after mankind has gone extinct. It extrapolates on evolutionary trends and hypothesizes on how
               certain ecological niches will be filled when humans and the species we either directly or 
               indirectly control (such as cattle, horses, wolves and deer) have vanished. Not only does Dixon present
               an interesting and reasonably scientifically-grounded argument, but he also provides some extremely
               well-done illustrations of his various thought-experiment species.

               <li><h2><u>Norse Mythology</u></h2></li>
               <h3>By: Neil Gaiman</h3>
               <br><br>
            
               <p>A recent addition to my library, acclaimed author Neil Gaiman takes the wit and style that 
                  made him famous and applies them to the myths of the ancient Norse. These millenia-old tales
                  have new life breathed into them, a sense of immediacy in Gaiman&apos;s short story-style not 
                  present in older, more academic retellings. While sadly not in an illustrated format,
                  the vivaciousness of Gaiman&apos;s prose can very well make you think otherwise.
